  <h2 style="color: white">What makes a bagel delicious?</h2>

  <p style="color: white">
    Many people have differing opinions on what really makes the best bagel. What they fail to realize, however, is
    that my opinion is the right one. Today I will explain how to prepare a bagel properly. Also included is a
    definitive list of the best bagels.
  </p>


  <h3 style="color: white">Savory or Sweet?</h3>
  <p style="color: white">
    Some people believe that a bagel has a right to be sweet. They are simply incorrect. A bagel has no right to
    venture into the world of sweetness. To do so would be creating a dessert, and a joke, of a breakfast. If you want
    to eat dessert for breakfast, eat a muffin or bearclaw, and leave bagels out of it. A savory bagel is what everyone
    should desire in a food. Cream cheese topping (savory of course) makes the perfect finish to such a perfect food.
  </p>
  <h3 style="color: white">How to Prepare a Bagel (Correctly)</h3>

  <ol style="color: white">
    <li>Plug in toster, and set dial to medium setting. A burnt bagel is unacceptable, and will ruin your entire bagel
      experience.</li>
    <li>Slice your bagel. Although pre-sliced bagels are okay, who would want to miss out on the experience of cutting a
      bagel? No one.</li>
    <li>Put the bagel in the toaster and push down the lever</li>
    <li>Wait for your bagel to finish toasting. Maybe put on a <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=846cjX0ZTrk">tune</a> while you're waiting for an optimal bagel toasting
      experience</li>
    <li>Your bagel is properly toasted. Time for the most important part...</li>
    <li>Cream cheese. Using the right cream cheese can make or break your bagel. Sure, there are other bagel toppings,
      such as peanut butter, lox, and just plain old butter, but cream cheese is the best hands down (and fish is gross
      ew).</li>
    <li>Finally, eat your bagel and thank the gods for creating such a delicious treat</li>


  </ol>


  <h3 style="color: white">
    So, What is the Best Bagel?
  </h3>

  <p style="color: white">
    Now is the moment you've been waiting for. You probably skipped the recipe just to see my bagel ranking, and I
    don't blame you (though I did really put my heart and soul into those bagel preparation instructions but its
    whatever... I guess...) Anyways! Here it goes.
  </p>


  <h4 style="color: white">#5 Plain</h4>

    alt="plain bagel" style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

  <p style="color: white">
    It's a classic, what can I say. So much room for versatility, which means theres room for the bagel to be
    delicious, but also room for it all to go so, so wrong (im talking about peanut butter. Please, unless you really
    need that protein, DO NOT put peanut butter on a bagel it is so dry im begging you).
  </p>

  <h4 style="color: white">#4 Everything</h4>

    alt="everything bagel" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

  <p style="color: white">Everything bagels are great, I mean obviously, they made it on the list. The seeds give it a
    nice crunchiness.
    However, everything bagels aren't higher on the list due to the fact that when you even think about them, seeds just
    appear everywhere. Oh no... the seeds have begun appearing. I need to stop thinking about them, now I've cursed you
    with the thought of the everything bagel! Whatever its worth it because everything bagels are good.</p>

  <h4 style="color: white">#3 Sesame</h4>

  <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ-ZCqeulJ9Pmsy0W4W5y-3QOX0zgKZtPzB9Q&usqp=CAU"
    alt="sesame bagel"  style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

  <p style="color: white">It may seem contriversial to put the sesame higher than the everything. I mean, there's less
    seeds, less crunch!
    That is true, but sesame bagels include one of the best seeds, AND they fall off way less. I can eat a sesame bagel
    and only deal with a few fallout seeds. I don't know what seed glue they use, but it's waaay beter than the glue
    they use for everything.</p>

  <h4 style="color: white">#2 Asiago Cheese</h4>

    alt="asiago bagel"  style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

  <p style="color: white">Cheese+Bagel+More Cheese. It's good. Great even. Highly recomend (Though I don't recomend it
    more than the next
    bagel).</p>

  <h1 style="color: white">#1 Multigrain</h1>

  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/285/files/20187/5b630fef2cfac24ff782bda0_Multigrain+Bagel/Multigrain+Bagel_s.jpg"
    alt="multigrain bagel" style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

  <p style="color: white">I already know the hate I'm going to get for this. I can see the imaginary comments at the
    bottom of this page
    blasting me for daring to have such a bagel as my top choice. <b>"BUT WHAT ABOUT '_____' BAGEL, DANI? WHAT ABOUT
      THOSE,
      WHY AREN'T THEY NUMBER ONE?"</b> or <b>"YOU'D HAVE TO BE INSANE TO ENJOY A MULTIGRAIN BAGEL!!!!!"</b> Guess what?
    I'm blocking
    out the haters. I love multigrain and I'm not afraid to say it. It's crunchy, its hearty, it's got seeds. Maybe at
    my core, I am but a woman who craves seeds. And the best part, is there is minimal fallout, with maximum
    crunchiness. I feel like a woman living on a prarie while I eat it. I imagine that the cream cheese has been made
    from the milk of the cow I keep in the barn, and that it has been aged in the comfort of my own home. Say what you
    want, multigrain is the <em>best</em> bagel. </p>

  <h3 style="color: white">Good Cream Cheeses</h3>

  <p style="color: white">Okay, I honestly don't have too strong of opinions on cream cheeses (i'll even admit, there is
    one type of SWEET cream cheese I enjoy so maybe you'll want to stay around to read that). Really the only reason I
    included this list is because I need an unordered list, which is appropriate because I don't really have a ranking
    of cream cheeses, just ones that I like. </p>

  <ul style="color: white">

    <li>Pumpkin, I don't care if it's sweet its good on a plain bagel and I really like pumpkin flavored things</li>
    <li>Chive and onion</li>
    <li>Plain</li>
    <li>sriracha</li>
    <li>vegetable</li>

  </ul>
