  <p>Hello everyone, its dani back at it again with another opinion section. Today I will be discussing my opinions on
    the animal crossing villagers that I have had on my acnh island. I will be ranking them from worst to best and
    giving them a tier</p>

  <main>
    <h3>Leopold</h3>
    <img
      src="https://oyster.ignimgs.com/mediawiki/apis.ign.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons/7/7a/Leopold_HD.png?width=325"
      alt="Leopold" style="width:400px;height:auto;">

    <p>God where do I even start with this awful creation. Leopold is literally the worst thing I have laid my eyes
      upon. Everyday I would go water my flowers, talk to my other villagers, and then come across Leopold. I was faced
      with 2 options: Ignore him, or hit him with my net (or option 3: push him into a pitfall seed). You can guess
      which option I usually chose. Then, I would go to Isabelle and complain about how much I wanted Leopold to leave
      my island. Every day spent with Leopold on my island was comparable to a day spent in hell. Every day since
      Leopold left has been a blessing. I don't dislike Leopold for no good reason. No, look at that face, the disdain
      he casts upon everyone he sees. Leopold is not just a smug type villager, nintendo just didn't know what type to
      give him and gave him the closest thing.Instead, Leopold is a demon type villager, a villager who emerged from the
      deepest layer of hell to taunt everyone who was cursed with him coming to their island.</p>

    <h4>Rating: -100/ 10</h4>
    <h4>tier: Z </h4>

    <h3>Knox</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlChn11.png" alt="Knox" style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

    <p>Okay, my opinions on Knox aren't too strong even though he's second to last. My only question is, "why?" I
      literally never asked for him to move to my island, he was autofill, and he is just so boring. The only redeeming
      quality is his interior design, which is not as ugly as some of my higher ranking villagers, but still. I don't
      really like the cranky villagers.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 1/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: F</h4>

    <h3>Hamphrey</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlHam07.png" alt="Hamphrey" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>Again with the cranky villagers. They are usually annoying. Hamphrey is just there and slightly bothersome, but
      he is a little bit adorable so I'll give him that</p>

    <h4>Rating: 2/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: F</h4>

    <h3>Cranston</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlOst06.png" alt="Cranston" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>Usually lazy villagers are cute and fun but I don't like cranston. He just moved on my island and I didn't even
      realize he moved in until I just randomly came accross him and was like, ...Okay? He's nothing specialk, he has no
      adorable charm to him, nothing! His design is kinda okay, so that's why he's highter on the list.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 2/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: F</h4>


    <h3>Dora</h3>
    <img src="https://preview.redd.it/3uv96w5s9oh61.png?auto=webp&s=a5f3469c928fb0cb2be69eba892299c7ce208141"
      alt="Dora Dora" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />
    <p>Dora is just a boring b. Her house is boring, her design is boring, she is basic. Her catchphrase is literally
      "squeak." That's boring. Whoever was in charge of her design really didn't care, and I don't blame them because
      who wants to be in charge of designing a mouse villager (no one). Idk though, shes not really annoying so shes a
      bit higher on the list. </p>


    <h4>Rating: 3/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: D</h4>


    <h3>Robin</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlBrd01.png" alt="Robin" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>I don't know, I just don't really like Robin. I mean, shes cute I guess, but she's just there. She moved off my
      island just for Cranston to move in so, minus points for that.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 4/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: D</h4>

    <h3>Lyman</h3>
    <img src="https://dodo.ac/np/images/a/a5/Lyman_NH.png" alt="Lyman" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />
    <p>I like most of the koala's, and I like Lymans design. He's kind of lovable in a stupid way, but I don't like the
      jock villagers, so he's not very high on my list.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 5/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: C</h4>

    <h3>Stu</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlBul03.png" alt="Rodeo" style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>

    <p>I wasn't a fan of stu at first, I don't know why. He is a lazy villager, and I love lazy villagers. Stu definitly
      isn't my favorite lazy, but he's adorable.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 5/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: C</h4>


    <h3>Rodeo</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlBul01.png" alt="Rodeo" style="width:400px;height:auto;"/>
    <p> Rodeo's another villager I didn't like at first, I think because he was autofill. However, he minds his own
      business, he has a nice house, and he has a nice design, so he's okay.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 5/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: C</h4>




    <h3>Pango</h3>
    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ema8zVDXcAcHRV7.png" alt="Pango" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />
    <p>Ugh, I love peppy villagers, they are the moment. They bring the drama in the best way possible. Pango was either
      the first or second villager that moved to my island other than the starter villagers, so she's kind of nostalgic.
      I feel like a lot of people dislike Pango, but I like her. She's not my favorite, but shes cute.</p>

    <h4>Rating: 6/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: B</h4>


    <h3>Willow</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlShp07.png" alt="Willow" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>The combination of pink and yellow in willow's design is top tier, and she plays the cello (? i think she plays
      it at least, she has a cello in her house ?). Love &#60;3</p>

    <h4>Rating: 7/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: A</h4>

    <h3>Muffy</h3>
    <img src="https://carboncostume.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Muffy-from-Animal-Crossing.jpg" alt="Muffy"
      style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>Muffy is a great villager. She was one of my starters (along with Lyman) and she has never had a problem with me.
      She along for the long ride and I love that . Sisterly villagers are so fun and I just love Muffy.</p>

    <h3>Goldie</h3>

    <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqRdRHqXAAIbKSX.png" alt="Goldie" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>Goldie is one of the characters I got in boxes. I saw someone had her in boxes and I was like take my money. Shes
      literally so adorable, and the only dog villager i've ever had (dog villagers are great).</p>

    <h4>Rating: 9/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: A</h4>

    <h3>Chai</h3>
    <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcR_ZFpbR3PF3TBozy-eyCNFh8dKPyPXBMSEGg&usqp=CAU"
      alt="Chai" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>Sanrio. If there's one thing about me, Im a sanrio girly. I am a slave to capitalism when it comes to sanrio. So,
      as you can imagine, I bought all of the sanrio amibos for animal crossing. First of all, they all give such cute
      furniture, and (most) of the actual villagers have really cute designs. So far, I have only been able to invite
      chai to my island (I would probably have more if my annoying villagers moved off of my island. But yeah, chai is
      adorable, and I love cinnamoroll so yeah chai top tier</p>

    <h4>Rating: 10/10</h4>
    <h4>Tier: S</h4>


    <h3>Mitzi</h3>
    <img src="https://acnhcdn.com/latest/NpcBromide/NpcNmlCat01.png" alt="Mitzi" style="width:400px;height:auto;" />

    <p>MITZI. I <em>LOVE</em> MITZI. She is literally the most adorable villager. I got her in boxes, and shes literally
      the best thing about my island tbh. Her catchphrase is literally "mew." MEW. THAT IS SO ADORABLE AHHH. One time
      she had a thought bubble and I was going to cry. THANKFULLY she did not move off my island. </p>
